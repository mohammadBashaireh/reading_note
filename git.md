# Git 
**in order to understand git you need to read about version control**

first we are gonna understand the **version control**
so basicly version control is a tool were you can track the changes that happened to your project and get the version you want.
there are three types of **VC**:

1. **local version control** 
2. **centralized version control**
3. **distrebuted version control** 

### * local version control:
*the project is stored in your device*

### * centralized version control:
*the project is stored in a server and the server store all changes and file versions to inhance the need of collaboration between developing team which can be accessed
by all the team members, and it allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities with certain files,
 and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.*

 
### * destributed versionn control:
*this type is created to cure the possible lose of project if the original device is detroyid in local VC,*
*To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories.*
 *These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.*
 *Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories,*
*programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project,* *which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.*

## git: 
**is a distrebuted version control system that stores a data in a file system made up of snapshots.** 
**each time you make a change in your project it is stored in a new version.**
